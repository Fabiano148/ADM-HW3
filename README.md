# ADM-HW3
## In HW3_Fabiano_Evangelista-Consegna.ipynb/HW3_Fabiano_Evangelista-Consegna.py you can find the code for Homework 3.

## You can find some screenshots and files that show how files are saved:
### "Micro_Directory.PNG" shows the first directory. Here I save the List_of_url.txt, the directories for every best books ever list's page, the vocabulary.json, the inverted_index.json, the Output.tsv.

### "List_of_url.txt" shows the list of urls.

### "vocabulary.json" shows the dictionary that maps each word to an integer.

### "inverted_index.json" shows the dictionary where the keys are the term_id while the values are the articles in which the word is present.

### "page_1.PNG" shows the content of one directory (in that case the page 1 with the first 100 books). Here are saved the html pages and the tsv files.

### "article0.tsv"/"article0.PNG" shows the output for the firs book (The Hunger Games).

### "Output.tsv"/"Output.PNG" shows the result of the query.
